# Roster

Roster Live Site https://teamrosterga.herokuapp.com/

SUMMARY/DESCRIPTION: Roster is an app dedicated to all sports team that want to have an interactive way to see all teammates and players' info. Most teams including mine, use an excel sheet to keep tabs and that leads to a lot of unneeded data. Roster is a way to optimize that info and be able to quickly find what you are looking for.

Technologies Used: Ruby, Rails, Postgres SQL, React with full CRUD.

APPROACH TAKEN: In the beginning we were really focused on just one model which was players. We ended up adding another model which was focused on all teams. In that way, you could put teams in the database that are competitors. This app is really going to be able to used by any sport that is a team sport and requires a roster, as well as keeping tabs every team in the league. We added login and authorization which we had some trouble with, but definitely something we will end up going back to. The homepage was also added to give the user a description on how to use the app. All in all, we are all very happy for how it has turned out thus far. Our team balanced each other out very well.


It was great working with Alec and Tate, we really worked together well but we were also able to go off on our own and take care of the specific problems we were looking to solve. We definitely worked off of eachother's strengths.
