# Roster

Roster Live Site

SUMMARY/DESCRIPTION: Roster is an app dedicated to all sports team that want to have an interactive way to see all teammates and players' info. Most teams including mine, use an excel sheet to keep tabs and that leads to a lot of unneeded data. Roster is a way to optimize that info and be able to quickly find what you are looking for.

Technologies Used: Ruby, Rails, Postgres SQL, React with full CRUD.

APPROACH TAKEN: 


It was great working with Alec and Tate, we really worked together well but we were also able to go off on our own and take care of the specific problems we were looking to solve. We definitely worked off of eachother's strengths.
